<h1>How It Works</h1>
<h3>The Audit</h3>
<p>Our Funds Recovery Specialists audit many different governmental agencies across the country to locate sums of money owed to private individuals and companies. If this money goes unclaimed for too long, it is usually lost to the government agency holding them.</p>
<h3>Call Us</h3>
<p>If we've contacted you be it via a phone call or a letter, it's because we have discovered funds that we believe belong to you. Please contact us as soon as possible so we can start your claim at 630-408-6574.</p>
<h3>Paperwork and Payment</h3>
<p>After speaking to one of our agents and verbally agreeing to let us work your claim, we will set up a time for you to sign the paperwork that allows us to get started.</p>
<p>Our firm works on a contingent basis - there is no out-of-pocket expenses to you. We get paid ONLY upon successful collection of your claim. We handle ALL expenses related to your claim until it's recovered, and if we are unsuccessful then you don't owe us anything.</p>
<p>After receiving our paperwork, we will send a local notary to collect it from you and they'll ship it overnight back to our office. This process usually takes anywhere between 2-4 weeks, and your collected funds (typically 50-60% of the funds collected), are returned to you within 30 days of receipt.</p>
