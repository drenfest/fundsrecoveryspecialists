<h1>Our Company</h1>
<p>Funds Recovery Specialists is a small group of financial recovery professionals located in Illinois. If we've contacted you via a call or a letter, we've found some of your funds being held by the government and those funds may be rightfully yours.</p>
<p>We know all about the "ins and outs" of government agencies throughout all states. If your funds are being held by a government agency, then we know how to acquire them! Don't wait! After a certain period of time passes, the government may keep your funds, it's always best when you have a professional like us on your side.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Don't let your funds "escheat" to the government agency holding them, meaning that you can no longer claim them. The money is yours, and the government shouldn't be able to take it from you. Our mission is to ensure that your funds aren't claimed by the government agency. We audit government agencies in order to find files and documents for these unclaimed funds, and once the funds are found, we make it our personal mission to deliver them back to their rightful owner.</p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>We'd love to see you reclaim the funds we've found for you! What would you do with a nice, unexpected payday? In this economy, everyone's got a use for extra money. Let's make sure the government doesn't end up with it!</p>
