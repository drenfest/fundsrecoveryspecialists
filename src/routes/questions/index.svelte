<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h3>How Did You Find This Money?</h3>
<p>We audit different government agencies on a regular basis for unclaimed funds due to citizens like yourself.</p>
<h3>How Did You Find Me?</h3>
<p>We usually locate our clients by doing internet searches.</p>
<h3>How Much is My Claim? Where is it Being Held?</h3>
<p>Once you have signed our contingency fee agreement, we'll be happy to disclose where the funds have been located!</p>
<h3>Can't I Find the Money on my Own?</h3>
<p>The governmental agencies we audit typically DO NOT post these unclaimed funds accounts online. You are welcome to search state unclaimed funds websites, but if you find funds there, these are not the funds we're informing you about.</p>
<h3>Why Should I Use Your Company?</h3>
<p>Most of the assets we locate aren't available by searching the internet, and it's unlikely that without the aid of a company like ours, that you'll be notified of their existence by the agency holding them. </p>
